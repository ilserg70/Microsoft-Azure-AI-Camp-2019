# Horovod-Infiniband-Benchmark

This recipe shows how to reproduce [Horovod distributed training benchmarks](https://github.com/uber/horovod/blob/master/docs/benchmarks.md) using Azure Batch AI.

Currently Batch AI has no native support for Horovod framework, but it's easy to run it using Batch AI custom toolkit.


## Details

- Official Horovod Benchmark [scripts](https://github.com/alsrgv/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) will be used;
- The job will be run on standard tensorflow container ```tensorflow/tensorflow:1.8.0-gpu```;
- Horovod framework and IntelMPI will be installed in the container using job preparation command line. Note, you can build your own docker image containing tensorflow and horovod instead.
- Benchmark scripts will be downloaded to GPU nodes using job preparation command line as well, stored in `$AZ_BATCHAI_JOB_TEMP` at each node
- This sample needs to use at least two `STANDARD_NC24r` nodes, please be sure you have enough quota
- Standard output of the job will be stored on Azure File Share.
- This recipe ONLY reproduce the training results with synthetic data on NVIDIA K80 GPUs.

# Caffe2 GPU Distributed

This example demonstrates how to run standard Caffe2 resnet50_trainer.py example using Batch AI. You can run it on a single or multiple compute nodes.

## Details

- Standard Caffe2 sample script [resnet50_trainer.py](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/blob/master/caffe2/python/examples/resnet50_trainer.py) is used;
- MNIST Dataset has been translated into a lmdb database, and can be obtained at http://download.caffe2.ai/databases/mnist-lmdb.zip;
- NFS will be used for rendezvous temp files to coordinate between each shard/node 
- Standard output of the job will be stored on Azure File Share.

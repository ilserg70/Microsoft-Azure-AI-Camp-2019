# CNTK

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (https://cntk.ai), is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. CNTK can be included as a library in your Python, C#, or C++ programs, or used as a standalone machine learning tool through its own model description language (BrainScript).

See official CNTK GitHub page (https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/).

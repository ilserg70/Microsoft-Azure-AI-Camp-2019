# Tutorials

## Python tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * [Python Tutorial](catboost_python_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows some base cases of using catboost, such as model training, cross-validation and predicting, as well as some useful features like early stopping,  snapshot support, feature importances and parameters tuning.

* CatBoost model analysis tutorials:
    * [Object Importance Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/catboost_object_importance_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to evaluate importances of the train objects for test objects. And with using of importance scores detect noisy train objects.

    * [SHAP Values Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/shap_values_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to use [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) python-package to get and visualize feature importances.

* CatBoost performance at different competitions:
    * [Kaggle Paribas Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/kaggle_paribas.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to get to a 9th place on paribas competition with only few lines of code and training a CatBoost model.

    * [ML Boot Camp Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/mlbootcamp_v_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This is an actual 7th place solution by Mikhail Pershin. Solution is very simple and is based on CatBoost.

* CatBoost and TensorFlow:
    * [CatBoost & TensorFlow Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/quora_catboost_w2v.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to use CatBoost together with TensorFlow if you have text as input data.

* CatBoost and CoreML:
    * [CatBoost CoreML Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/catboost_coreml_export_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to convert CatBoost model to CoreML format and use it on an iPhone.

## R tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * [R Tutorial](catboost_r_tutorial.ipynb)
        * This tutorial shows how to convert your data to CatBoost Pool, how to train a model and how to make cross validation and parameter tunning.

## Command line tutorials

* Main CatBoost tutorial with base features demonstration:
    * [Command Line Tutorial](catboost_cmdline_tutorial.md)
        * This tutorial shows how to train and apply model with the command line tool.

## Custom loss tutorial

* Adding custom per-object error function tutorial:
    * [Custom Metrics Tutorial](advanced_tutorials/catboost_custom_metric_tutorial.md)
        * This tutorial shows how to add custom per-object metrics.
